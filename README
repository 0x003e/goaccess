INTRODUCTION
-------------
GoAccess is an open source real-time Apache web log analyzer and 
interactive viewer that runs in a terminal and provides fast and 
valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that require a 
visual report on the fly.

How it works and what it does?
-------------------------------
Essentially, the way GoAccess works is that it will parse the 
well-known Apache access log file, from there, GoAccess will collect data 
from the parsed file and it will display it to the console or the X terminal. 
The collected information or generated reports will be displayed to the 
user/sysadmin in a visual/interactive window. Reports include:

    * General Statistics, Bandwidth etc.
    * Top Visitors
    * Requested files
    * Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.
    * Referrers URLs
    * 404 or Not Found
    * Operating Systems
    * Browsers and Spiders
    * Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location
    * HTTP Status Codes
    * Referring Sites
    * Keyphrases
    * Different Color Schemes
    * Unlimited log file size

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly analyze 
and view web server statistics in real time  without having to 
generate huge web reports. You can see it more as a monitor 
command tool than anything else. (or at least that's the intended purpose)
