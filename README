What is it?
-------------
GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer 
and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems. 
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system 
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

Features
-------------------------------
GoAccess parses the specified web log file and 
outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

   * General Statistics, bandwidth etc.
   * Time taken to serve the request (useful to track pages that are slowing down your site)
   * Top Visitors
   * Requested files
   * Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.
   * Referrers URLs
   * 404 or Not Found
   * Operating Systems
   * Browsers and Spiders
   * Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location
   * HTTP Status Codes
   * Referring Sites
   * Keyphrases
   * Support for IPv6
   * Different Color Schemes
   * Unlimited log file size
   * Custom log format
   * Output statistics to JSON, CSV or HTML.

Nearly all web log formats...

GoAccess allows any custom log format string.
Predefined options include, but not limited to:

   * Common Log Format (CLF) Apache
   * Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF) Apache
   * W3C format (IIS).
   * Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution).
   * Apache virtual hosts

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly 
analyze and view web server statistics in real time 
without having to generate an HTML report. 
Although it is possible to generate an HTML report, 
by default it outputs to a terminal.

You can see it more as a monitor command tool than anything else.
