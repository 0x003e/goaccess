INTRODUCTION
-------------
GoAccess is a free and open source Apache web log 
analyzer that provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics 
for system administrators that require a visual report on the fly.

How it works and what it does?
-------------------------------
Well, basically the way GoAccess works is by parsing the well-known 
Apache access log file, then GoAccess will collect data from the 
parsed file and it will display it to the console or the X terminal. 
The collected information will be displayed to the user (sysadmin) 
in a visual/interactive window. This information includes data such as:

    * General Statistics, Bandwidth etc.
    * Top Visitors
    * Requested files
    * Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.
    * Referrers URLs
    * 404 or Not Found
    * Operating Systems
    * Browsers and Spiders
    * Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location
    * HTTP Status Codes
    * Referring Sites

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly analyze 
and view web server statistics without having to generate huge reports. 
You can see it more as a monitor command tool than anything else. 
(or at least that's the intended purpose)


Keys
----
The user can make use of the following keys:

    * ^F1^            main help
    * ^q^             quit the program/current window
    * ^o^             open detail view for selected module
    * ^TAB^           iterate modules (forward)
    * ^SHIFT^ + ^TAB^ iterate modules (backward)
    * ^RIGHT ARROW^   open detail view for selected module
    * ^0-9^           select module so the user can open a
    		          [detail view] with either ^o^ or ^RIGHT ARROW^ 
	* ^s^             [detail view] sort unique visitors by date
    * ^S^             [detail view] sort unique visitors by hits
    * ^/^             [detail view] search forward for the
                      occurrence of pattern 
	* ^n^             [detail view] find the position of the next
					  occurrence 
	* ^t^ 			  [detail view] move to the first item
    * ^b^ 			  [detail view] move to the last item
