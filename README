INTRODUCTION
-------------
GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer 
and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems. 
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system 
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

How it works and what it does?
-------------------------------
Essentially, GoAccess will parse the specified web log file; 
from there, it will collect data from the parsed log 
and it will display it to the console or the X terminal. 
The collected information or generated reports will be 
displayed to the user/sysadmin in a visual/interactive window. 
Reports include:

    * General Statistics, bandwidth etc.
    * Top Visitors
    * Requested files
    * Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.
    * Referrers URLs
    * 404 or Not Found
    * Operating Systems
    * Browsers and Spiders
    * Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location
    * HTTP Status Codes
    * Referring Sites
    * Keyphrases
    * Support for IPv6
    * Different Color Schemes
    * Unlimited log file size
    * Custom log format
    * Output statistics to a file. See report. 

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly 
analyze and view web server statistics in real time 
without having to generate an HTML report. 
Although it is possible to generate an HTML report, 
by default it outputs to a terminal.

You can see it more as a monitor command tool than anything else.
