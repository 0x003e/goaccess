What is it?
-------------
GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer 
and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems. 
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system 
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

GoAccess parses the specified web log file and 
outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

   * General Statistics, bandwidth etc.
   * Top Visitors

   * Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF) Apache

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly 
analyze and view web server statistics in real time 
without having to generate an HTML report. 
Although it is possible to generate an HTML report, 
by default it outputs to a terminal.

You can see it more as a monitor command tool than anything else.
