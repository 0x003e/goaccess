     with an additional unknown argument.
   * Tarball's filename was changed.

Changes to GoAccess 0.2 - Sunday, July 25, 2010

      This includes, raw, cache, and translation queries.
    * Implemented screen resize functionality
    * Various small speed increases & code cleanup

    * Simplify the "process_unique_data" function
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)

    * Clean up code a little bit
    * Fixed a segmentation fault when displaying the help text on x86_64.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed casts associated with "g_hash_table_iter_next".
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed two format strings. (If the error was ever triggered, it'd most 
      likely lead to a segfault.)
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed assignments in conditions. In case the assignment is actually 
      intended, put extra parenthesis around it. This will shut GCC 
      (and others) up.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer types.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
