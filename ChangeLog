Changes to GoAccess 0.2 - Sunday, July 25, 2010

    * Implemented real-time statistics (RTS). Data will be appended as the log file
      grows. Equivalent to 'tail -f' on Unix systems
    * Added a keyphrases report coming from Google search engine.
      This includes, raw, cache, and translation queries.
    * Implemented screen resize functionality
    * Various small speed increases & code cleanup
    * Fixed a memory leak when invalid entries were parsed
    * Simplify the "process_unique_data" function
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Simplify creation of the "unique visitors" hash-key.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.2 - Monday, July 12 2010

        Ex. ("GET HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1")

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.1 - Saturday, July 10 2010

    * Added an enhanced error handling
    * Added Glibc LFS
    * Added an extra macro on configure.ac to check against GHashTableIter. 
      ./configure might not check for glib 2.16 that introducted 'GHashTableIter'.  
    * Clean up code a little bit
    * Fixed a segmentation fault when displaying the help text on x86_64.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed casts associated with "g_hash_table_iter_next".
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed two format strings. (If the error was ever triggered, it'd most likely lead to a segfault.)
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed assignments in conditions. In case the assignment is actually intended, put extra parenthesis around it. This will shut GCC (and others) up.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer types.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed includes.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
    * Fixed function declarations.
         (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
