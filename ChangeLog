Changes to GoAccess 0.1.1 i - Sat Jul 10 2010

    * Added an enhanced error handling
	* Added Glibc LFS
	* Added an extra macro on configure.ac to check against GHashTableIter. 
		./configure might not check for glib 2.16 that introducted 'GHashTableIter'.  
	* Clean up code a little bit

	* Fixed a segmentation fault when displaying the help text on x86_64.
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed casts associated with "g_hash_table_iter_next".
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed two format strings. (If the error was ever triggered, it'd most likely lead to a segfault.)
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed assignments in conditions. In case the assignment is actually intended, put extra parenthesis around it. This will shut GCC (and others) up.
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer types.
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed includes.
			 (Thanks to Florian Forster contribution)
	* Fixed function declarations.
