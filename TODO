What features are you planning to incorporate?

    * For sure I'm planning to increase the performance when parsing the log.
    * In addition to that, I'm planning to have a tail functionality for real time view.
    * Add more reports to it.
    * Add command-line parameters.
	* Filtering data by date.
	* Work on 'terminal resize' functionality, so all windows are properly resized.
